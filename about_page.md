About Project CID 

Project CID (Competency Insight Dashboard) is a national initiative to monitor and strengthen the digital competence of people in the Netherlands so they can participate safely and effectively in an increasingly digital society. Building on the validated DigIQ tool, and its extension the DigIQ2.0, measuring eleven key dimensions of digital skills (from online safety and digital health to AI and sustainable technology), Project CID tracks how different groups across the population are coping with rapid technological change, including developments like generative AI. It will do so by conducting six data-collection waves between 2024 and 2027, and all resulting data will be integrated into this dashboard. 

With these timely insights, policymakers and practitioners can design targeted workshops and training for different age and education groups, develop accessible programs for vulnerable populations, and launch awareness campaigns on issues such as AI, privacy, and information reliability.  

 

Methodology 

Project CID maps the digital competencies of the Dutch population using a mixed sampling strategy that combines an online panel with a postal address sample. The address sample specifically targets neighborhoods with higher proportions of people with lower educational levels and/or a migration background, ensuring inclusion of groups that are underrepresented in online-only research and of people with lower (digital) literacy. Data are collected via a questionnaire available in Dutch and English, which can be completed online (smartphone, tablet, computer) or on paper. Data collection for Project CID is conducted by the external research company Ipsos I&O, ensuring professional and standardized fieldwork 

Because the resulting sample differed from national benchmarks (MOA Gold Standard 2024) on key demographics, statistical weights were applied so that the results more accurately reflect the Dutch population.
