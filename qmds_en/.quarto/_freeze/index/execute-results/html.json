Digital competence consists of digital skills and knowledge, such as the skills and knowledge needed to use online media and digital technology safely and effectively, as well as the performance of these skills through tests and behavioral measurements. Digital competence is broken down into 11 dimensions.\n\nBy using multiple surveys at different times with different samples, we can gain a clear picture of the current state of digital competence among Dutch people, whether it is changing, and which groups of people are most vulnerable online.\n\n{{< iconify ph chart-bar-fill >}} This dashboard allows you to examine general trends in digital skills, knowledge, and performance for each of the 11 dimensions, with the option to differentiate by age, gender, education level, and migration background.\n\nMore information about DigIQ2.0 can be found at [https://osf.io/dfvqb/overview](https://osf.io/dfvqb/overview).\n\n{{< iconify ph envelope-simple-open-fill >}} For questions about the dashboard or DigIQ2.0, please email [digiq-cw-fmg@uva.nl](mailto:digiq-cw-fmg@uva.nl).\n\n<small>This project was made possible by a grant from the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (principal investigator: Piotrowski).</small>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<center><img src='bzk.jpg' width='360'></center>\n</div>\n\n",
