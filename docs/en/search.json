    "text": "THIS IS A MOCKUP VERSION PLEASE DO NOT CITE\nThis dashboard contains the results of multiple data collections using the DigIQ2.0, a measurement instrument that maps the digital competence of Dutch people aged 10 and older. Digital competence consists of digital skills and knowledge, such as the skills and knowledge needed to use online media and digital technology safely and effectively, as well as the performance of these skills through tests and behavioral measurements. Digital competence is broken down into 11 dimensions.\nBy using multiple surveys at different times with different samples, we can gain a clear picture of the current state of digital competence among Dutch people, whether it is changing, and which groups of people are most vulnerable online.\n This dashboard allows you to examine general trends in digital skills, knowledge, and performance for each of the 11 dimensions, with the option to differentiate by age, gender, education level, and migration background.\nMore information about DigIQ2.0 can be found at https://osf.io/dfvqb/overview.\n For questions about the dashboard or DigIQ2.0, please email digiq-cw-fmg@uva.nl.\nThis project was made possible by a grant from the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (principal investigator: Piotrowski).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Wave 1 Key Findings\nHere are the key findings from Wave 1 of the Digital Competence study.\n\n People generally feel digitally skilled, and this largely corresponds with their knowledge, but not always with their performance. For some skills, such as online health and well-being, or netiquette, there are discrepancies between people’s high scores on trust in their own skills and low scores on performance and behavior. These findings may indicate that Dutch people have blind spots regarding (some) digital skills and are unaware of what is possible online and where they actually lack skills.\n Skills and knowledge in the field of (gen)AI are low. Children, the elderly, and low-educated Dutch people score low on knowledge about the privacy, validity, and reliability of genAI and the personalization of news and entertainment by AI, and are not well-equipped to create prompts that leverage the benefits of genAI. People perform poorly in recognizing and using genAI, and, aside from social media, don’t always know which apps or websites use AI to tailor content to them.\n Differences among Dutch people can be distinguished based on age and education level, not on migration background. Children (10–14 years old), the elderly (66+), and the less educated score lower on digital skills and knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
