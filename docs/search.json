Whether for homework, social media posts, or just curiosity, Gen Z and even Gen Alpha are driving the adoption of these technologies at an astonishing pace.\nThe flood of AI-generated images, videos, and memes means it’s almost impossible to grow up today without encountering artificial intelligence. For many, AI isn’t a futuristic concept: it’s a daily companion. Young people now turn to tools like ChatGPT for information, writing help, and even casual conversation. This has been documented in the Dutch AI Opinion Monitor, which shows that young people are the fastest adopters of this technology."

When asked how confident they felt using prompts to get useful responses from ChatGPT, a striking 71.2% of 16–25-year-olds said they were confident. Even among those aged 10–15, more than half (54.4%) expressed confidence in their ability to prompt AI effectively.\nIn other words, pre-teens today feel just as capable of “talking to AI” as many highly educated professionals in their thirties and forties. This growing sense of mastery highlights how intuitively young people adapt to new technologies. But confidence isn’t the same as competence."
